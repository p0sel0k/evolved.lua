# Roadmap

## Backlog

- Improve the performance of required fragments by caching first-level required chunks.
- Improve the performance of builders that are used multiple times by caching hint chunks.
- Queries can cache major chunks to avoid finding them every time.
- Add a function to shrink storages to free unused memory.
- observers and events
- add INDEX fragment trait
- use compact prefix-tree for chunks
- optional ffi component storages

## Thoughts

- We can return deferred status from modifying operations and spawn/clone methods.
- Should we make one builder:build method instead of :spawn and :clone?
- Should we cache the result of without_unique_fragments to clone faster?
