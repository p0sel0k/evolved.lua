# Roadmap

## Backlog

- observers and events
- add INDEX fragment trait
- use compact prefix-tree for chunks
- optional ffi component storages

## Thoughts

- We can return deferred status from modifying operations and spawn/clone methods.
- Should we make one builder:build method instead of :spawn and :clone?

## Known Issues

- Required fragments are slower than they should be
